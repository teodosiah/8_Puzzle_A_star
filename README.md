# 8_Puzzle_A_star
C# algorithm which solves 8 Puzzle problem using A* algorithm.

Problem description:
An 8 puzzle is a simple game consisting of a 3 x 3 grid (containing 9 squares). One of the squares is empty or '0' in our case. 
The object is to move to squares around into different positions and having the numbers displayed in the "goal state".

Given an initial state of 8-puzzle game and a final state of to be reached, find the most cost-effective path to 
reach the final state from initial state using [A star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) algorithm 
and the [Manhattan distance algorithm for heuristic](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html).

The algorithm displays the length of the path from start to goal state that we were given from the beginning.
